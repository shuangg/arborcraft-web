# 🚀 ArborCraft Deployment Guide

## 📦 Distribution Files

Your ArborCraft website has been built and packaged for deployment. You have two distribution options:

- **`arborcraft-web-dist.zip`** (75KB) - Standard ZIP archive
- **`arborcraft-web-dist.tar.gz`** (75KB) - Compressed TAR archive

## 📁 Build Contents

The `dist/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `assets/index-BifI7vtA.css` (22.87 KB) - Optimized CSS bundle
- `assets/index-kx_LM7zO.js` (240.04 KB) - Optimized JavaScript bundle
- `_redirects` - Netlify routing configuration

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### 1. **Netlify (Recommended)**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder or upload the ZIP file
3. Your site will be live instantly with a custom URL
4. The `_redirects` file ensures proper React Router handling

### 2. **Vercel**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository: `shuangg/arborcraft-web`
3. Vercel will auto-detect Vite and deploy automatically
4. Custom domain available

### 3. **GitHub Pages**
1. In your GitHub repo, go to Settings → Pages
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose `main` branch and `/dist` folder
4. Your site will be available at: `https://shuangg.github.io/arborcraft-web`

### 4. **Traditional Web Hosting**
1. Extract the ZIP/TAR file
2. Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your web server's public directory
3. Ensure your server supports SPA routing (redirect all routes to index.html)

### 5. **AWS S3 + CloudFront**
1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Upload `dist/` contents
3. Configure bucket for static website hosting
4. Set up CloudFront for CDN and custom domain

## ⚙️ Server Configuration

For proper React Router functionality, configure your server to:
- Serve `index.html` for all routes that don't match static files
- Set proper MIME types for CSS and JS files
- Enable gzip compression for better performance

### Apache (.htaccess)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(?!.*\.).*$ /index.html [L]
```

### Nginx
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```
